---

### 08:30 – 09:00 | Welcome & DevOps Mindset

**Content:**
- Recap from AI/ML session (Series #1)
- **DevOps Culture & Principles:**
  - Breaking silos between Dev & Ops
  - Shared responsibility & automation mindset
  - Continuous improvement philosophy
  - Fail fast, learn faster

---

### 09:00 – 10:30 | AWS DevOps Services – CI/CD Pipeline

#### Source Control Strategy

**AWS CodeCommit:**
- Git-based version control (AWS-managed)
- Alternative to GitHub/GitLab
- Integration with AWS services

**Git Strategies:**
- **GitFlow:** feature branches, release branches, hotfixes
  - Best for: Formal releases, multiple environments
  - Complexity: Higher, more branches
  
- **Trunk-based Development:** commit frequently to main
  - Best for: Continuous deployment, faster feedback
  - Requires: Strong CI/CD pipeline, good testing

**Best Practices:**
- Code reviews mandatory
- Pull requests tied to issues
- Branch protection rules
- Commit message standards

#### Build & Test: CodeBuild

**CodeBuild Features:**
- Fully managed build service
- Supports: Java, Python, Node.js, Docker, etc.
- Buildspec.yml for configuration
- Parallel test execution

**Build Pipeline:**
```
Source → Compile → Unit Tests → Integration Tests → Artifacts
```

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests (fast feedback)
- Integration tests (component interaction)
- End-to-end tests (user flows)
- Performance tests (load testing)

#### Deployment: CodeDeploy

**Deployment Strategies:**

1. **Blue/Green Deployment:**
   - Maintain 2 identical environments
   - Switch traffic when new version ready
   - Pros: Zero downtime, instant rollback
   - Cons: Requires double resources

2. **Canary Deployment:**
   - Route small % traffic to new version
   - Monitor metrics
   - Gradually increase traffic
   - Pros: Detect issues early with minimal impact
   - Cons: Takes time

3. **Rolling Deployment:**
   - Gradually replace instances
   - Pros: No extra resources needed
   - Cons: Brief service degradation possible

**Rollback Strategy:**
- Automated rollback on health check failures
- Manual rollback capability
- Database migration reversibility

#### Orchestration: CodePipeline

**Pipeline Stages:**
```
Source → Build → Test → Deploy → Production
```

**Features:**
- Trigger on code push
- Approval gates before production
- Artifact management
- Pipeline visualization
- Parallel execution support

#### Live Demo: Full CI/CD Pipeline

**Demo Flow:**
1. Developer pushes code to CodeCommit
2. Webhook triggers CodePipeline
3. CodeBuild runs tests & builds artifact
4. CodeDeploy deploys to staging
5. Manual approval gate
6. Deploys to production (Blue/Green)
7. Automated rollback if health checks fail

**Key Insight:** "From code commit to production in minutes, safely"

---

### 10:30 – 10:45 | Break

---

### 10:45 – 12:00 | Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### AWS CloudFormation

**Concept:**
- Describe AWS infrastructure as YAML/JSON templates
- Infrastructure becomes code = version control, reproducibility
- Stack management (create, update, delete)

**Template Structure:**
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: 'Web application stack'
Parameters:
  Environment: Type: String (dev, staging, prod)
Resources:
  - EC2 Instances
  - RDS Database
  - Security Groups
  - Load Balancer
Outputs:
  - Application URLs
```

**Key Features:**
- **Stack Operations:** Create, update, delete infrastructure
- **Change Sets:** Preview changes before applying
- **Drift Detection:** Detect manual changes to infrastructure
- **Nested Stacks:** Modular, reusable templates

**Use Cases:**
- Replicate environments (dev → staging → prod)
- Disaster recovery (rebuild infrastructure)
- Multi-region deployments
- Compliance automation

#### AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)

**Concept:**
- Write infrastructure using programming languages (Python, TypeScript, Java)
- Higher-level abstractions than CloudFormation
- Compiles to CloudFormation templates

**Advantages vs CloudFormation:**
- **Language-based:** Type safety, IDE support, loops/conditions
- **Constructs:** Pre-built patterns (L1, L2, L3 levels)
- **Reusable:** Code libraries & patterns
- **Less verbose:** More concise than YAML

**Example (TypeScript):**
```typescript
new ec2.Instance(this, 'WebServer', {
  vpc: vpc,
  instanceType: ec2.InstanceType.of(
    ec2.InstanceClass.T3,
    ec2.InstanceSize.MEDIUM
  ),
  machineImage: new ec2.AmazonLinuxImage(),
});
```

**When to Use:**
- **CloudFormation:** Simple infrastructure, learning
- **CDK:** Complex patterns, reusable libraries, large projects

#### Demo: Deploying with CloudFormation & CDK

**Demo 1: CloudFormation**
- Create template for web application
- Deploy stack
- Update infrastructure
- Show change set
- Detect drift

**Demo 2: CDK**
- Write infrastructure in TypeScript
- Synthesize to CloudFormation
- Deploy using CDK
- Show generated template

**Key Comparison:**
| Aspect | CloudFormation | CDK |
|--------|---|---|
| Learning Curve | Easier | Steeper |
| Flexibility | Good | Excellent |
| Code Reuse | Nested stacks | NPM packages |
| Verbosity | More YAML | Less code |

### 12:00 – 13:00 | Lunch Break (Self-arranged)

---

### **AFTERNOON SESSION (13:00 - 17:00)**

---

### 13:00 – 14:30 | Container Services on AWS

#### Docker Fundamentals

**Containerization Concept:**
- Package application + dependencies into container
- Same behavior on laptop, staging, production
- Lightweight vs VMs

**Microservices Architecture:**
- Monolith → Microservices
- Each service: independent, scalable, deployable
- Communication: APIs, message queues
- Benefits: Scalability, resilience, technology diversity

**Container Benefits:**
- Consistent environment
- Faster deployment
- Resource efficiency
- Scaling agility

#### Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)

**Features:**
- Push/pull Docker images
- Image scanning for vulnerabilities
- Lifecycle policies (auto-delete old images)
- Cross-account access
- Integration with CodeBuild

**Best Practices:**
- Tag images with version/commit hash
- Use lifecycle policies to manage storage
- Enable image scanning
- Private repositories by default

#### Amazon ECS vs EKS

**ECS (Elastic Container Service):**
- AWS-native orchestration
- Simpler, less operational overhead
- EC2 or Fargate launch types
- Integrated with AWS services (ALB, IAM, CloudWatch)

**EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):**
- Kubernetes orchestration (industry standard)
- More powerful, steeper learning curve
- Self-healing, auto-scaling
- Multi-cloud portability

**Comparison:**
- **Choose ECS:** AWS-first, simpler operations
- **Choose EKS:** Need Kubernetes portability, complex orchestration

**Deployment Strategies:**
- Rolling updates (no downtime)
- Blue/green deployments
- Canary releases

#### AWS App Runner

**Simplified Container Deployment:**
- Deploy from source code or container image
- Automatic scaling, load balancing
- No need to manage infrastructure
- Perfect for: Startups, simple applications

**Use Case:** Developer push code → automatic CI/CD → running service

#### Demo & Case Study: Microservices Deployment

**Architecture Comparison:**
1. **Monolith on EC2:** Simple but scaling difficult
2. **Microservices on ECS:** Managed, AWS-integrated
3. **Microservices on EKS:** Powerful, portable
4. **Serverless with Lambda:** Ultimate simplicity

**Real-world Case Study:**
- Startup: App Runner
- Scale-up: Migrate to ECS
- Enterprise: Kubernetes (EKS)

### 14:30 – 14:45 | Break

---

### 14:45 – 16:00 | Monitoring & Observability

#### CloudWatch

**Metrics:**
- Track application & infrastructure metrics
- Custom metrics from application
- Automated dashboards
- Real-time data visualization

**Logs:**
- Centralized log aggregation
- Query with Insights
- Real-time monitoring
- Log retention policies

**Alarms:**
- Trigger on metric thresholds
- SNS notifications
- Lambda actions
- Auto-scaling triggers

**Best Practices:**
- Monitor business metrics (not just infrastructure)
- Use log grouping by application
- Meaningful alarm thresholds

#### AWS X-Ray

**Distributed Tracing:**
- Track requests across services
- Visualize architecture
- Identify bottlenecks

**Insights:**
- Performance analysis
- Error attribution
- Service dependency map

**Use Cases:**
- Debug slow requests
- Understand service interactions
- Optimize performance

#### Demo: Full-Stack Observability Setup

**Demo Flow:**
1. Application sending metrics to CloudWatch
2. Logs aggregated & queried
3. X-Ray tracing microservices
4. Dashboard showing health
5. Alert triggering on anomaly

**Architecture:**
```
Application → CloudWatch (metrics & logs)
           → X-Ray (distributed tracing)
           → Dashboard (visualization)
           → Alarms (automated response)
```

**Key Insight:** "If you're not monitoring it, you can't improve it"
