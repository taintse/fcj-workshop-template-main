The system consists of two parts of source code requiring dependencies.

#### Step 1: Install for Backend

Navigate to the backend Lambda directory and install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
cd backend/src/lambda
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies defined in the `package.json` file for the Lambda function.

#### Step 2: Install for CDK

Go back to the CDK root directory and install CDK dependencies:

```bash
# Go back to CDK root directory
cd ../../../cdk
npm install
```

This installs the AWS CDK libraries and constructs needed to synthesize and deploy the infrastructure.
