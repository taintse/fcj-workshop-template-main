#### Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Instead of manually clicking through the AWS Console ("ClickOps"), we use **AWS CDK** to define our entire infrastructure. In the file `cdk/lib/backend-stack.ts`, we have designed a complete Serverless system.

When you run the `cdk deploy` command, CDK synthesizes this code into a **CloudFormation Template**, and AWS automatically provisions the corresponding resources.
