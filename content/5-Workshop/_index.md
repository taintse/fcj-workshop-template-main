# Building a Serverless Backend with AWS CDK

#### Overview

In this workshop, you will build a complete **Serverless Backend** for the **FindNest** application - a boarding house rental platform. You will use **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)** to define and deploy your infrastructure as code.

You will learn how to:

- Deploy serverless infrastructure using AWS CDK with TypeScript
- Build RESTful APIs with API Gateway and Lambda
- Implement authentication with Amazon Cognito
- Store data in DynamoDB with proper data modeling
- Integrate AI capabilities with Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3)
- Add map functionality with Amazon Location Service
- Apply security best practices with IAM policies
- Manage infrastructure lifecycle (deploy and cleanup)

#### Architecture

You will deploy a modern serverless architecture consisting of:

- **API Gateway** - RESTful API endpoints
- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless compute (Node.js)
- **Amazon DynamoDB** - NoSQL database (7 tables)
- **Amazon Cognito** - User authentication and authorization
- **Amazon S3** - Image storage
- **Amazon Location Service** - Maps and geocoding
- **Amazon Bedrock** - AI/ML with Claude 3
- **Amazon SNS** - SMS notifications
- **CloudWatch Logs** - Monitoring and logging
