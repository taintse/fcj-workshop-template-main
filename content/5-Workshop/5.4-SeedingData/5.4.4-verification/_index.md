Let's ensure the user exists in both the Authentication service and the Database.

#### A. Check Cognito (Authentication)

1. Go to [Amazon Cognito Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
2. Select **User Pool** `FindNestUsers`
3. Go to **Users** tab

You should see your `superadmin` with status **Confirmed**.

Click on the user and verify they are in the **Admins** group.

The user should have:

- Group membership: **Admins**

#### B. Check DynamoDB (Data)

1. Go to [DynamoDB Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
2. Select the table **UserProfiles**
3. Click **Explore table items**

Search for the item where `userId` matches the ID from the script output.

You should see the profile data with `userType: "admin"`.

#### Verification Checklist

Confirm the following before proceeding:

- ✅ User exists in Cognito User Pool with status **CONFIRMED**
- ✅ User is a member of the **Admins** group
- ✅ User profile exists in DynamoDB **UserProfiles** table
- ✅ Profile has `userType` set to `"admin"`
- ✅ All user attributes (email, fullName) are correctly populated

#### Next Steps

You are now ready to log in and test the system!
