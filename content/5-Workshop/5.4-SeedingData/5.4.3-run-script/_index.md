Now, execute the script. It is interactive, so it will ask you for details.

#### Execute the script

```bash
node seed-admin.js
```

#### Interactive Walkthrough

The script will prompt you for the following information:

1. **Username**: Enter a username (e.g., `superadmin`)
2. **Password**: Enter a strong password (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special chars)
3. **Email**: Enter a valid email address
4. **Full Name**: Enter a display name
5. **Confirm**: Type `yes` to proceed

#### Expected Output

If everything is configured correctly, you should see output similar to this:

```plaintext
