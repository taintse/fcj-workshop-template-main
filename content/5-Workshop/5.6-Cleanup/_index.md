#### Why is cleanup important?

In a Cloud environment, you pay for what you provision. Even though Serverless services like Lambda and DynamoDB (On-Demand) have a generous Free Tier or low idle costs, other resources might incur charges over time:

- **S3 Storage**: You pay for the data stored in buckets
- **Amazon Location Service**: Storing Place Indexes or using Maps
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Stored log data

To prevent unexpected billing, always clean up your environment after completing a workshop.
