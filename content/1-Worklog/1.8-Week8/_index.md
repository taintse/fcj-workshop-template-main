* Practice handling API data and rendering on map

### Tasks to carry out this week:
| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference |
| ---- | --------- | ------------ | --------------- | --------- |
| 2 | Study Swagger API: read documentation, understand API structure, test endpoints to fetch room list. Document endpoints, parameters, and response format. | 2/11/2025 | 3/11/2025 | Swagger Documentation |
| 3 | Design Map interface layout: create basic HTML/CSS for map, sidebar info, search filters. Use framework/library (React, Vue, or vanilla JS). | 3/11/2025 | 4/11/2025 | Google Maps API, Leaflet docs |
