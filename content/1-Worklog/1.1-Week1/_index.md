### Tasks to be carried out this week:
| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2   | - Connect and interact with FCJ team members to build initial rapport and understand the working environment. <br> - Review and summarize the internship guidelines, rules, and regulations to ensure proper compliance during the program.                                                                                                   | 9/8/2025 | 9/8/2025      |
| 3   | - During this day, I focused on exploring the AWS ecosystem to understand how cloud computing services operate in practice. I learned that AWS offers a wide range of tools that support various needs — from running virtual machines, storing and securing data, to managing databases and network connections. This helped me form a clear picture of how companies use AWS to build scalable and flexible cloud infrastructures.| 9/9/2025 | 9/12/2025      | <https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/> |
| 4   | I created an AWS Free Tier account and began exploring the AWS environment hands-on. I learned how to navigate the AWS Management Console and practiced using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with cloud resources directly from the terminal. During the process, I installed and configured the CLI by setting up access keys, regions, and profiles. This helped me understand how both the web console and CLI complement each other in managing AWS services.| 9/10/2025 | 9/14/2025      | <https://000001.awsstudygroup.com/1-create-new-aws-account/> |
| 5   | Learned how to monitor and control cloud expenses using AWS Budgets by setting cost limits and alerts to track spending and avoid unexpected charges.| 9/11/2025 | 9/12/2025      | <https://000007.awsstudygroup.com/> |
| 6   | - Learned how to manage access permissions in AWS using IAM. Practiced creating and configuring users, groups, and roles, and applied security policies to control access to AWS resources securely.| 9/12/2025 | 9/15/2025      | <https://000002.awsstudygroup.com/> |


### Week 1 Achievements:

* During the first week, I successfully completed all onboarding and introductory activities related to the AWS cloud environment. I became familiar with the First Cloud Journey (FCJ) team, learned about the organization’s working process, and gained a solid foundation in AWS core services.
* Key achievements include:

    * Learned to track and control expenses using AWS Budgets to prevent unexpected costs.
    * Became confident in navigating between the Console and CLI for different AWS operations.
* Overall, Week 1 provided a strong starting point in both technical skills and teamwork, laying the groundwork for deeper learning in upcoming weeks.
