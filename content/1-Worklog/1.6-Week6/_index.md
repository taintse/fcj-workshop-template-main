### Week 6 Objectives:

* Advance knowledge in Identity and Access Management (IAM) with advanced concepts
* Learn about Amazon DynamoDB - a fully managed NoSQL database service
* Practice creating, configuring, and managing DynamoDB tables
* Understand DynamoDB pricing models and best practices

### Tasks to carry out this week:
| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference |
| ---- | --------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 2 | Review IAM Advanced concepts: policy evaluation logic, resource-based policies, and permission boundaries. Practice writing more complex policies. | 20/10/2025 | 21/10/2025 | https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html |
| 3 | Learn DynamoDB basics: tables, items, attributes, primary keys (partition key & sort key). Create a simple table with on-demand billing. | 21/10/2025 | 22/10/2025 | https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html |
| 4 | Practice CRUD operations on DynamoDB: insert, query, update, and delete items. Use AWS Console and AWS CLI. | 22/10/2025 | 23/10/2025 | https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html |
| 5 | Learn about DynamoDB indexes (Global Secondary Indexes - GSI, Local Secondary Indexes - LSI) and how to use them for query optimization. Create and test a GSI. | 23/10/2025 | 25/10/2025 | https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SecondaryIndexes.html |
| 6 | Wrap-up: review IAM policies for DynamoDB access, check CloudWatch metrics, and clean up unnecessary resources. Document important steps. | 24/10/2025 | 25/10/2025 | Personal notes |

### Week's Achievements:

* IAM Advanced:
  * Deepened understanding of policy evaluation logic and resource-based policies
  * Successfully wrote complex policies for DynamoDB access control

* DynamoDB Fundamentals:
  * Successfully created and configured a DynamoDB table
  * Understood key schema concepts and attribute types
  * Practiced on-demand billing vs provisioned throughput

* CRUD Operations:
  * Successfully performed insert, query, update, and delete operations
  * Used AWS Console and AWS CLI for data management
  * Verified response times and performance metrics

* Indexing & Optimization:
  * Created Global Secondary Index for query optimization
  * Understood when to use GSI vs LSI
  * Checked query performance metrics

### Conclusion:

This week provided a solid foundation in DynamoDB - a highly scalable NoSQL service. Combining IAM enables secure and efficient access control.
