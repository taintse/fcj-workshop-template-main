## Introduction

When **JC Boissy's** serverless card game **CloudJack-21** was honored at the **2024 AWS Game Builder Challenge**, it marked a remarkable milestone in his cloud computing journey. Among **331 submissions** from developers worldwide, his educational card game stood out.

This achievement is even more notable because **JC had very little real-world cloud experience** before joining **AWS Cloud Institute** – an online training program that helps learners start cloud development in just **nine months**.

---

## Career at a Crossroads

JC Boissy's path to cloud development was far from straightforward. With years of experience transitioning from:
- **Software development** → **Management** → **IT project management**

JC had built a solid career in technology. But when his company **closed at the end of 2023**, JC found himself at a **critical juncture**.

### Finding a New Path

"After several months of job searching, I realized something important," JC explains. "Today, applying for high-level tech positions relies not just on past experience but on who you know, and more importantly, on having **real technical skills**."

The landscape had **changed significantly** from his early programming days. Although he had managed cloud projects as a project manager, **JC had never worked directly with those technologies**.

"I remember doing pure technical work," he recalls. "But I knew I needed to **upskill to keep up with current technology**."

## Finding His Path with AWS Cloud Institute

Initially, JC **discovered AWS Cloud Institute** by chance while looking for opportunities for his son. Upon reviewing the program details, he realized **he was the one who needed it**.

"It had been a long time since I last studied, and technology had changed so much. I needed to get back to modern technology."

### Full-Time Learning Commitment

"AWS Cloud Institute was truly a gift from heaven," JC says. "The program provided **exactly what I needed** – a structured roadmap to become a cloud developer who can build applications end-to-end. I decided to **go all in**, dedicating full-time effort to rebuilding my technical foundation."

Joining AWS Cloud Institute marked a **significant commitment**. Although he had managed cloud projects, JC admits:

"Until joining AWS Cloud Institute, I **had no real hands-on cloud experience** – just abstract concepts about cloud computing."

### Comprehensive Approach

What particularly attracted him to the program was its **comprehensive approach**.

"The program is **led by people at the source** – real AWS experts. I couldn't have gotten this perspective from self-studying. They helped me focus on the **big picture** while **building practical skills**."

JC dove into the program's **rigorous learning curriculum**, which includes:
- **Twelve courses** in professional and technical skill development
- **Over 150 hands-on labs**
- **Preparation for two AWS certifications**

He started **applying new knowledge immediately**, beginning with small applications.

"I decided to **start deploying small applications** to build confidence," JC shares. "My first project was a static website, but I knew I wanted to do more. The program gave me the **foundation to tackle increasingly complex projects**."

## CloudJack-21: Where Games Meet Cloud Learning

### From Idea to Reality

"Initially, I wasn't sure whether to join the **AWS Game Builder Challenge**," JC recalls. "But I had a Python code for a blackjack game, and during an Advanced course at AWS Cloud Institute, I **had an idea** – I could **turn each card into an AWS service**, creating an engaging way to teach cloud concepts."

### Game Mechanics

The game **CloudJack-21** combines **classic blackjack mechanics** with **cloud computing education**. Players build virtual cloud infrastructure using **AWS service cards**, with each card representing real services with authentic characteristics.

**The game has two phases:**

**1. Infrastructure Building:**
- Players aim to **build a cloud architecture** with a **total value under 21**

**2. Cloud Battle:**
- Players take on the role of **"Cloud Robber"** or **"Cybersecurity"**
- Use **challenge cards** or **defense cards**

"I wanted to create something **both fun and educational**," JC says. "The challenge was **balancing gameplay with accurate AWS service simulation**."

## Leveraging AI for Serverless Success

### Technologies Used

To create CloudJack-21, JC leveraged **AWS services**:
- **AWS Lambda**
- **Amazon DynamoDB**
- **Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)**
- **Amazon CloudFront**
- **Amazon Route 53**

### AI Tools in Development

As part of the **AWS Game Builder Challenge** requirements, JC also used AI tools like:
- **Amazon Q Developer**
- **PartyRock**

"These tools **acted like a virtual team member**," JC explains. "They help with everything from **code suggestions** to **content creation**, which was crucial given the **tight development timeline**."

### Development Challenges

But the development process **wasn't without challenges**.

"**Time constraints** were a critical factor," JC admits. "I worked with a **very tight deadline**, which pushed me to **prioritize efficiency** and **maximize AI tools** during the challenge."

JC also emphasizes the learning process:

"I **learned new programming languages and AWS services** while building the game. This process was **stressful but incredibly rewarding**."
